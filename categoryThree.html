            <p class = paragraphThree0>- Create function is to add an element into the csv file, read function is to search for an element depends on what ID
                <br>or type that they are searching for, the update function is when users are editing the element inside of the csv file, and then delete
                <br>function is to remove an element from the csv file.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class = paragraphThree>- All these four functions are used with using Python3. It can do the same work as using a MongoDB command, but 
                <br>for Python3, it is recommended when using a software called Jupyter Lab.<br><br> 
            </p>
            <p class = paragraphFour>- This project would be the best fit for other students that wants to become a data scientist, since they heavly 
                <br>focus on python, jupyter software, and mySQL or NoSQL.
