        <p class = "paragraphThree">This image above it was my previous project from CS-330, what changed is the table and more items are added with texture.<br>Here are some of the coding reviews
        that I use to update this project.</p>
        <h3 class = "codeReview">Code Review:</h3>
        <img class = "codeShapes" src = "images/shapes.png" alt = "3D Shapes">
        <div class = "boxFour">
            <br><br>
            <p class = "paragraphFour">As you can see, this is an image of creating a 3D Shape called a box. Here are different ways to modify a 3D Shape: </p><br>
            <p class = "paragraphFour1">- Scale(line 893): the scale is where you will resize the shape smaller or bigger.</p>
            <p class = "paragraphFour2">- Rotation(line 896-898): the rotation is when you are modifying of how you are facing the 3D Shape.</p>
            <p class = "paragraphFour3">- Position(line 901): the position is that you are moving the shape to a certain spot.</p>
            <p class = "paragraphFour4">- Color(line 911): where it says SetShaderColor() function, it means that you can modify<br> the color of the 3D shape depending on the rgb you have set.
                <br> There are other functions like SetShaderMaterial() and SetShaderTexture().
            </p>

        <h3 class = "headTexture">3D Texture</h3>
        <img class = "codeTexture" src = "images/texture.png" alt = "3D Textures">
        <div class = "boxFive">
            <p class = "paragraphFive">In order to add texture to 3D shapes, it will need to be installed into the code with an image.</p><br>
            <p class = "paragraphFive1">- Each bReturn variables will grab an image into a texture.</p>
            <p class = "paragraphFive2">- the "BindGLTextures()" function will bind all of the images into 3D shape texture once each variables are completed.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class = "headLightning">3D Lightning</h3><br>

        </div>
        <div class = "boxSixImage">
            <p class = "paragraphSix">There are two types of lightning functions that will create a full shape will lighning effection:</p>
            <p class = "paragraphSix1">- The code snippet on the left shows different lightning effections which are ambientColor, ambientStrength, diffuseColor, specularColor, and shininess.</p>
            <p class = "paragraphSix2">- The "tag" from the seventh line will connect this function to a specific 3D shape depending on the name.</p><br>
            <p class = "paragraphSix3">- The code snippet on the right side shows that each light sources will covered, so an order to have a full display 3D shape with
                <br>light effections, it needs to have lightSources[0], lightSources[1], lightSources[2], and lightSources[3]. (If missed any, then a 3D shape will look like
                <br>it is cut in half).

            <p class = "paragraphSeven2">Created a python book right next to the C++ book and a rust book at the top of the wooden shelf.</p>
            <p class = "paragraphSeven3">Changed the table texture to a wooden table and I change the adjustments of the table to make it more sturdy.</p>
