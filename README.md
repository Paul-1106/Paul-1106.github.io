<h2>Self Assessment</h2>
Completing my coursework thoughout the program and developing my ePortfolio has helped me showcase my strengths including all my computer science courses is when I am setting up to land a technology job like C++ software engineer. README is a great example that I would have a great chance to get hired from a job when employees are looking at other people's projects and the README file will be the first thing that employees will see, so for my experience, it is important to create a good README with as much information as possible. My explanation of how to make a good README file is to search it up to see good examples of creating a README and then try to make it better than the one that you research.

When collaborating in a team environment, it is important when giving feedback on a job or always work as a team to get the project or product done quicker. Software Development Life Cycle course is a perfect example when collaborating the team for example, scrum master will collaborate their team when creating a product. The only time that I collaborate the team is when we were in a group and I was a team lead when creating a full stack website of the app store. Just like when I collaborate with other people from my group, I also communicate with my team for giving each steps on what to do with different tasks. Data stuctures and algorithms in my opinion is the strongest part when it comes to coding in general and it has boost up my level of programming in C++. I have mostly learn like binary search tree, hash tables, linked list, and math coding. Database like MongoDB is where I know about create a query, read a query, update a query, and delete a query. For security, I have created registration and log in while developing from mobile app development course and full stack development course. 
<br><br>
In one of my computer science courses that I have start learning C++, it was my new favorite programming language and the course was called introduction to programming. That was when I started to improve programming with C++ and creating coding projects outside of school, like using OpenGL for computer graphics, C++ with Jupyter Notebook for data projects, etc. 
Which is why I have selected Computer Graphics and Visualization (CS-330) as my first category since it is based on C++ programming creating 3D models with using OpenGL and it was one of my strongest courses. Then I have picked data structures and algorithms (CS-300), because courses like CS-300 is very important for tech interview in my field like graphs, binary search tree, hash tables, and more. Lastly I choose Client/Server Development (CS-340) as my last category because out of all of the database that I use, MongoDB (NoSQL) is the only database that I am strong at and it is more of an open-source database for backend development.

<h3><u>Category I</u></h3>
- I have bulid this project from CS-330. This course is for computer graphic and engineering with using C++ and OpenGL.
- OpenGL is one of best 3D graphic designing software for other C++ developers to build 3D images or even open source games.

<h3><u>Category II</u></h3>
- I have build this project from CS-300. This course is data structure and algorithm with only using C++.
- For this project, you will only be seeing function of codes in binary search tree method.
- In the list of courses of a CSV file, my expectation for this project is to add a node, search for a node, update a node, sort a node and delete a node from the list.

<br>


<h3><u>Category III</u></h3>
- I have build this project from CS-340. This course is client and server development with using mongoDB, python, and Jupyter notebook.
- With using a CSV file, I can modify all the element listed in the CSV file with using mongoDB. 
- For a full stack development, I use python to handle the CRUD method function and then html for frontend development to create a dashboard page.
