<h3><u>Category I</u></h3>
- I have bulid this project from CS-330. This course is for computer graphic and engineering with using C++ and OpenGL.
- OpenGL is one of best 3D graphic designing software for other C++ developers to build 3D images or even open source games.

<h3><u>Category II</u></h3>
- I have build this project from CS-300. This course is data structure and algorithm with only using C++.
- For this project, you will only be seeing function of codes in binary search tree method.
- In the list of courses of a CSV file, my expectation for this project is to add a node, search for a node, update a node, sort a node and delete a node from the list.

<h3><u>Category III</u></h3>
- I have build this project from CS-340. This course is client and server development with using mongoDB, python, and Jupyter notebook.
- With using a CSV file, I can modify all the element listed in the CSV file with using mongoDB. 
- For a full stack development, I use python to handle the CRUD method function and then html for frontend development to create a dashboard page.
