        <p class = "paragraphThree">That includes adding node, removing node, searching a node, etc.</p>

        <p class = "paragraphFour1">However, using a binary search tree is generally harder than using a vector as a method, but it is
            <br>a best practice when learning complex data structures and algorithms in C++.</p>
